1. Immigration Case
-----------------------------------
C:\Users\danie\ws\LLMs\CodeUnderstanding\structured-docs-rag\.venv\Lib\site-packages\pydantic\_internal\_generate_schema.py:2249: UnsupportedFieldAttributeWarning: The 'validate_default' attribute with value True was provided to the `Field()` function, which has no effect in the context it was used. 'validate_default' is field-specific metadata, and can only be attached to a model field using `Annotated` metadata or by assignment. This may have happened because an `Annotated` type alias using the `type` statement was used, or if the `Field()` function was attached to a single member of a union type.

❓ Question: Why was the alien fiancé petition denied?
======================================================================

💡 Answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The petition was denied because the petitioner was a lawful permanent resident, not a U.S. citizen. The law only allows U.S. citizens to file fiancé(e) petitions (Form I-129F) for their foreign partners. While the petitioner indicated they intended to become a U.S. citizen, this was not sufficient as the nonimmigrant classification under the Immigration and Nationality Act is specifically limited to fiancé(e)s of U.S. citizens. However, the denial was without prejudice, meaning the petitioner could file a new petition once they become a U.S. citizen.

❓ Question: What was the trend in U.S. crude oil production from 2015 to 2017?
======================================================================

💡 Answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. crude oil production showed a declining trend during this period. Production peaked in 2015 at 9.42 million barrels per day, then decreased by 5.9% to 8.86 million barrels per day in 2016. The decline continued but at a slower rate into 2017, with a projected decrease of 0.9% to 8.78 million barrels per day. This represents a sustained downward trend over the two-year period, though the rate of decline moderated significantly in 2017 compared to the steeper drop seen in 2016.

❓ Question: What is the main purpose of this bill?
======================================================================

💡 Answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The bill, called the MORE Act (Maximize Offshore Resource Exploration), has two main purposes:

1. To allow offshore drilling along the California coast by revoking the congressional moratorium on offshore drilling

2. To establish a revenue-sharing system where states would receive 75% of the royalties from offshore drilling leases (increasing to 90% if states agree to drilling within 25 miles of their coastline)

The drilling would be permitted starting 25 miles from the shoreline, with the first 25 miles remaining under state control. The legislation was introduced as a response to high gas prices and aims to increase domestic oil production.

❓ Question: What is the purpose of this subcommittee?
======================================================================

💡 Answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I apologize, but I don't see any clear information about the purpose of the subcommittee in the provided context. While the context shows page labels from a document titled "ost_subcommittee_charter.pdf", the actual content describing the subcommittee's purpose is not included in the excerpts shown. To accurately answer this question, I would need additional context containing specific details about the subcommittee's purpose and objectives.
